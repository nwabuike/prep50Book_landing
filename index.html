        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Many students have labored to make A’s in their WAEC and JMAB exams
          but what if I can prove to you that the way they prepare for their
          exams already guarantees that they will fail, no matter how hard they
          try.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your son or daughter may currently be studying botany or zoology or
          biological Science ( I don’t even know what that means), although they
          wanted to study medicine, Engineering and /or law... What if there is
          way for him or her to be guaranteed of enough JAMB and Post UTME score
          that will enable them get admitted into any university of their choice
          to study medicine or any course of their choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such guarantee is hidden in the preparation tools used by the Award
          Winning Maltina teacher of the year....Her approach to exam
          preparations has yielded hundreds of successful results and counting
          for many families and your child can be one of the success stories if
          you permit.
        </p>

        <p>
          I actually mean guaranteed result of <b>‘320’</b> and above in JAMB on
          your first sitting and ‘A’s’ in your WAEC single sitting too, without
          losing one year or sorting anybody but a guaranteed 320 in Jamb on
          your first sitting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do u think it's impossible? Well let me bust your bubble... It is easy
          with the right tools and that is why I am introducing you to this age
          old solution which thousands have used to get high scores in Jamb and
          all A’s in WAEC.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well this is not totally a secret. If you have u ever picked up a
          textbook to read before, you will notice how each one is arranged in
          chapters with topics and subtopics. That is because, this is the
          scientifically proven way, human beings learn and assimilate info. It
          is unfortunate that during WAEC and JAMB preparations, teachers cram
          up everything and students use tools that end up making them more
          confused instead of making their preparations seamless.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those who first introduced the tools we use for exam preparations did
          not put these psychologies of learning in mind as they developed their
          work.
        </p>

        <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">
          The Benefits: What your child will gain by using the revealed secret:
        </h4>
        <p>
          We have labelled our own exam preparation tool “Prep50”. Using this
          tool, your child will effectively “<b>learn how to learn</b>”. This is
          very important. It is one of the most vital skills any student must
          have to succeed as a student.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some children think that learning is all about opening and reading a
          book, well they do that everyday in school without actually learning
          anything because learning requires more than the act of opening and
          reading. Learning has to be contextualized, bit-sized and
          well-structured and that is what prep50 comes with. Your child will
          learn how to organize his/her academic tasks in a way that will ensure
          that learning is always taking place and in a way that you can also
          measure what they have learnt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Secondly, your child will develop the ability to
          <b>think like an examiner/teacher</b>. This is a huge skill too for
          every student so long as your studies warrant that you will write an
          exam. By painstakingly going through the “Prep50” series, subject by
          subject, topic by topic, and sub-topic after sub-topic, the scales
          will fall off from your eyes and like it happened to Adam and Eve, you
          will know the world and you will begin to see how examiners create,
          craft and structure questions just to test your understanding.
        </p>

        <p>
          The beauty of this skill for your child is that every new textbook
          your child picks to read, he/she will be able to predict likely
          questions that can come from the topic. This prediction capacity will
          make your child will not to fail any exam again in their lifetime
          unless they did not prepare for it. If your child can think like the
          teacher, they will know the part of the textbook that any good teacher
          will set questions from and focus more on those areas.
          <b>(Top Secret)</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Prep50 promises you <b>an easy way to learn</b>. This will help your
          child to cover more topics than usual in a day and most importantly
          cover the entire syllabus before the exam. So they are very familiar
          with all questions from all the topics before the exam and
          consequently can attempt all questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prep50 helps you to be disciplined and avoid procrastination. Many
          schools usually start the exam preparations for the students only when
          they are already in SS3. This is very wrong as we learned from the
          award winning teacher. According to her, WAEC preparation starts in
          SS1 because the syllabus covers from SS1 to SS3.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence exposing the child to WAEC standard from the onset, gives
          him/her more advantage over those who started their preparations in
          SS3. We have structured our preparation tool to reflect every one of
          her advice to help your child start early on the journey to success.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, something spiritual happens that
          <b>improves your Retentive Memory</b> when studying with prep50. Using
          the prep50 structured learning approach, will help you to create
          neural networks in your brain. If you listen to radio programs,
          sometime you begin to complain why the same callers call-in everyday
          to share their opinion while hundreds of others find it hard to call
          into the program even for once in a year. The secret is neural
          networks.
        </p>
        <!--  -->
        <p>
          When you do something every day, you create a pathway in your mind for
          easy recall. By using Prep50 to study, your child will naturally
          create that neural networks between the subjects and his/her mind to
          enable for easy recall on the day of exam.
        </p>

        <h3 class="red-text text-lighten-2">The Secret Tool</h3>
        <p>
          Having learnt all these secrets from the award winning, Maltina
          Teacher of the year, we wanted to find a way to share this knowledge
          with every parent, every school and every student. We are also aware
          that everybody does not have access to this type of teacher in their
          respective schools... So we worked earnestly to put together the
          solution in a series of books which we have labelled the
          <b>Prep50 series (Hard copy & Soft copy</b>). We have the past
          question series in WAEC and JAMB but they are structured differently
          to ensure your child reaps all the benefits we have mentioned above
          and gain admission to study any course of their choice without bribing
          anybody.

          How and what tools, the students make use of during their exam

          still very cheap because people spend up to 500k to gain admission
          into medicine and law etc and the most unfortunate thing is that 80%
          of them lose their money that way and their student end up studying
          fishery or Plant science in school. But we will not charge you 150k
          because our main aim is not to make money but to help your child gain
          admission without bribe or sorting. We understand the condition of the
          country and for that the JAMB bundle is not even 20k or 15k but just a
          token of
          <b class="red-text text-lighten-2"
            >N10,000 and WAEC bundle is N15,000</b
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          If your child is still SS3 class and you decide to buy both bundles,
          we will give you a huge N2000 naira discount... So instead of 25k you
          only pay 22k...
        </p>

        <p>
          listen and think about it. This is not even up to what we spend on
          Dstv subscription in a term... And what do u get in return? News about
          death, destruction etc. but when u get this tool, you set your child
          up for life because if,... <b>No not If…. </b>for when your child
          scores 350 in Jamb and gets admitted into the University to study
          medicine or law or whatever course he/she loves, without your spending
          any dime or bribing anybody, you would have saved yourself millions.
        </p>

        <p>
          When he graduates, he can take care of him/herself and you too. Don't
          you want that for your child? I know you do. So that's why you need to
          click this button now, place your order, make payment and we will
          deliver to you.
